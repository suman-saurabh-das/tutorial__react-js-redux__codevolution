[17] Redux toolkit - Intro

Redux concerns
	• Redux requires too much boilerplate code
		○ Action
		○ Action object
		○ Action creator
		○ Switch statement in a reducer
	• A lot of other packages have to be installed to work with redux
		○ Redux-thunk - for async actions
		○ Immer - for handling nested state updates
		○ Redux-devtools - helps in debugging
Hence, there was a need to improve the developer experience for redux

Redux Toolkit
	• It is the official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development
		○ Abstracts over the setup process
		○ Handles the most common use cases
    ○ Includes some useful utilities
