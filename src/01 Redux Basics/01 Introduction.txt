What is Redux ?

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript Apps.
	• It is for JavaScript apps.
	• It is a state container.
	• It is predictable.
	
Redux is for JavaScript applications
	• Redux is not tied to React.
	• Can be used with React, Angular, Vue or even vanilla JS.
	• Redux is a library for JavaScript applications.

Redux is a state container
	• Redux stores the state of your applications.
	• Consider a React app - state of a component.
	• State of an application is the state shared by all the individual components of that app.
    e.g. -
	    state = {
	        isUserLoggedIn: true,
	        username: "Saurabh",
	        profileURL: "...",
	        onlineUsers: []
	    }
	• Redux will store and manage the application state.

Redux is predictable
	• Predictable in what way ?
	• Redux is a state container and the state of an application can change.
	e.g. todo list app - item (pending) -> item (completed)
	• In redux, a pattern is enforced to ensure all state transitions are explicit and can be tracked.

Why Redux ?
	• If you want to manage the global state of your application, in a predictable way, redux can help you.
	• The patterns & tools provided by Redux makes it easier to understand when, where, why & how the state in your application is being updated & how your application logic will behave when those changes occur.
	• Redux guides you towards writing code that is predictable and testable, which helps give you confidence that your application will work as expected.

What is Redux Toolkit ?
	• Redux toolkit is the official, opinionated, batteries included toolset for efficient Redux development.
	• It is also intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic in your application.

Why Redux toolkit ?
	• Redux is great, but it has a few short comings.
		○ Configuring redux in an app seems complicated.
		○ In addition to redux, a lot of other packages have to be installed to get redux to do something useful.
		○ Redux requires too much boilerplate code.
	• Redux toolkit serves as an abstraction over redux. It hides the difficult parts ensuring you have a good developer experience.

Redux toolkit featuring React
	• Redux or Redux toolkit don't need a UI library to work.
	• However we will be using Redux toolkit with React.
	
React-Redux package
	• React-Redux is the official Redux UI binding library for React. i.e. React-Redux offers a couple of functions that will help you connect your React application with Redux.
	
Summary
	• React is a library used to build user interfaces.
	• Redux is a library for managing state in a predictable way in JavaScript applications.
	• Redux toolkit is a library for efficient redux development.
	• React-redux is a library that provides bindings to use React and Redux (Toolkit) together in an application.

When to use Redux
	• You have large amounts of application state that are needed in many places in the app.
	• The app state is updated frequently over time.
	• The logic to update the state may be complex.
	• The app has a medium or large-sized codebase, and might be worked on by many people.
