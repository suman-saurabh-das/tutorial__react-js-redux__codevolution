/*
	[02] Setting up Project Directory

		• Install Node.js - from nodejs.org
		• Create a project folder (for 1st part of this series)
			e.g. redux-basics
		• In terminal Run : npm init --yes | (initializes a package.json file with default settings)
		• In terminal Run : npm install redux | (adding redux as dependency for our project)
		• Create a JS file -> index.js and add a log statement
			
		In the terminal Run : node "...fullPath/index.js" (we should see the log statement)
    e.g. node "x:\Workspace\Codebase\05 React\Code Evolution - React and Redux\tutorial__react-js-redux__codevolution\src\01 Redux Basics\02 ProjectSetup.js"
    OR right click and select Run code.

	NOTE - Since this is a react project, no need to run npm init, just install npm i redux so that we have the redux package and we can start with the code.
